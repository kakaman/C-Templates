# C-Templates
Data structures and algorithms written in C. Most are modified to be templates to be used in almost any situation.
The data structures under complete can be used right away.
The not implemented data structures should be used at users risk.
The in progress data structures are being implemented and/or upgraded with additional features in the inprogress branch. For explanations of the various data structures, go to the [wiki] (https://github.com/kakaman/C-Templates/wiki).
